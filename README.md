# For users ðŸ˜€

## ðŸ§¶ How to play?
Ball is a game that is very addictive in its simplicity.
You only need 4 movements or 4 keys on the keyboard to play.
There is a **map** on which there is a **ball** that paints all the **cells** on which it rolled.
The goal of the game is to color all the cells on the map. 
After passing the map, you go to a new level.

## ðŸ”­ How are maps generated?
To generate maps, an algorithm is used that generates a random number of cells in the range. 
After that, the walls `break through` and cells are obtained, along which the ball can then move. 
The generation doesn't end there. 
After that, the verification algorithm starts, because not all generated maps can have a finite number of movements to fill all cells of the map. 
If the map was successfully painted over for a large number of `monkey` movements, then the map is considered usable. 
After that, all maps that have reached this stage are sorted by the average number of `monkey` movements to complete the map.
Thus, at the beginning are the maps that had the least difficulty.
And the more levels the player goes through, the more the map has a higher level of difficulty.
